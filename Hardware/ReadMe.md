This folder will contain the schematics of hardware builds:
- Micro-power version with extremely low quiescent current that can handle panels up to 20W 
- Mid-power version with low quiescent current that can handle panels up to 300W, upon adding a power buck converter to the micropower version.
- High-power versions will never be build, buy commercial stuff.

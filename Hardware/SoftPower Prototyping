# Instructions to build the prototype

these are the instructions to build the INA3221 based prototype.  
We will start with a 5x7 CM prototyping board.  
The first thing will be to drill the fixation holes to 3,2mm. The corners will break, but that does not matter.

Then we will prepare the INA3221:

The 0.1 Ohm SMD shunt resistors will enable measurement up to 0.8Amps only, which is okay for a 10W panel.  
For bigger panels you need to replace the SMD shunt resistors with 0.01 Ohm models. Do not worry, replacing these kind of resistance is not rocket science.
Just put a good quantity of solder tin on the terminals and heat in short sequence both sides, then quickly shift away the SMD resitor with the tip of your iron.
You can do that! I could also, and I am an old man, not very far from getting Parkinson.
Then position the new resistor inplace and solder first one side, while you hold the item, then solder the other side with enough tin, and come back to the first side with fresh tin.

Then we will solder the screw terminals. I had 2- and three blocks available, which will allow me to place the ground terminals beneath the respective positive terminals, which is somewhat more logical disposition. Between the 2 GND holes, I am usually soldering a strong wire bridge, useful to clamp the GND of the multimeter.
If you only have 2-blocks, you can solder them directly onto the GND holes.

Then we will prepare the "Fine Red" 5V buck converter.

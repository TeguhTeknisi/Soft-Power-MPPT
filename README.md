Solar-Booster: the Swiss-Army-Knife-for-Solar Charge Controllers

The solution for solar charge controllers owners and those planning especially off-grid small installtions to visualize your battery level: 

Pimp dumb solar controllers and even add REAL MPPT (maximum power point tracking) to simple buckconverters and boost them  with elaboate networked display and reporting features...

There is a large choice of solar controllers on the market, from pretty cheap to awfully expensive ones. 

The purpose of this development is to provide networking and reporting abilities to low-end solar charge controllers, by adding a ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller to it. 

In the first variant, ESP8266 WiFi processor + INA226 power measuring interface + Online Dashboard the total value of the bill of material will be below 20â‚¬ !
